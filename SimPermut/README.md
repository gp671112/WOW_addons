## How Can I Use It?

/SimPermut


Select the slots to permut from the dropdown on the top left.

Select which items you want to sim.

Add enchants and gems on items that don't have any (you can force replace enchant and gem by selecting the force checkbox).

Click Generate.

Copy the text and paste in simc.

## AutoSimC Export

You can now export selected gear to an AutoSimC data (settings.ini) to externalize simc string generation. For a large number of items, it will be faster.

See [AutoSimC on GitHub](https://github.com/SimCMinMax/AutoSimC)
