## TotalAP v1.3.2 - Recent changes (3 releases)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

r22:
	Added option to toggle between using the international and localised number formats for each locale (experimental). It is accessible via slash command: /ap numberformat
	
	Updated detection for maxed artifact weapons (was disabled after tier 2 became available, but now applies to only tier 1 artifacts). They now show as "maxed" once again
	
	Fixed an issue that could cause high numbers of artifact power (> 2.14b) to break the addon's output under certain circumstances
	Fixed a bug that would cause tier 1 artifacts (those that haven't yet been upgraded via the Dalaran Council's quest chain) to display inaccurate values beyond the final, 54th trait
	Fixed a graphics glitch that caused the buttonText to collide with the bar display when using locales with a larger-than-normal default font size (koKR, zhCN, zhTW mainly) - this workaround is not ideal, and somewhat experimental
	
r21:
	Added slash command to hide the secondary progress bars ("MiniBar") -> /ap minibar
	
	Updated DB to include 7.2.5 artifact power items and their spell effects
	Updated translation for the Traditional Chinese (zhTW) locale - thanks for contributing!
	Modified progress bar tooltip to indicate when research is idle, and when the maximum AK level has been reached
	
	Fixed ingame description for the "/ap progress" slash command
	Fixed progress bar tooltip for artifact weapons that have never been used before
	Fixed a graphics glitch that could occur when the buttonText became too long to fit smoothly in its space
	Fixed a graphics glitch that lead to the MiniBar being displayed over other, arguably more important UI frames
	Fixed an issue where the displayed shipment info for Artifact Research Notes could be inaccurate
	
	
r20:
	Added secondary progress bar ("MiniBar"), which is displayed whenever more than one new trait is available
	
	ALT-clicking should now correctly allow dragging of the entire display, no matter which part was being clicked on (progress bars and spec icons included)
	Individual displays can no longer be dragged off-screen, and their anchor now resizes dynamically to make sure they fit even in the tightest corners ;)
	The action button now remains visible if artifact research notes (or similar tomes) are available, even if the active spec is being ignored

	Fixed broken localization for the recently-added progress tooltip
	Fixed various localization issues (such as a broken deDE translation and formatting mishaps)
	Fixed an oversight that would cause the initialisation routine to break on the very first login (or if the saved variables were deleted manually)
