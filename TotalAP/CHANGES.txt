## TotalAP v1.4.1 - Recent changes (3 releases)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

r24:
	
	Artifact Research Notes and similar items (catch-up tomes for alts) will now be ignored for players that haven't reached level 110 yet

	Fixed an issue that could prevent the displays from being dragged to the very bottom of the player's interface
	Fixed an issue where dropping from an instance group could cause the detection of ignored specs to fail temporarily
	Fixed a minor graphics glitch pertaining to the buttonText, manifesting only when AP items were stored in the bank
	Fixed the broken /ap reset slash command (caused by the changes made to saved variables handling in r23)
	

r23:
	Added support for artifact power items that are stored in the player's bank (experimental). They will be cached whenever the bank tab is opened, and the respective progress bars/tooltip lines can be disabled with the /ap scanbank command
	Added quest reward from the "Pillars of Creation" (Tomb of Sargeras) quest line to the addon's database. Somehow this wasn't added with all the other items from 7.2.5
	
	Saved variables are now managed differently. They should be migrated to the new format automatically; if something unexpectedly goes wrong, simply resetting them should fix it
	The progress bar tooltip will now indicate when a tier 1 artifact can be updated to its maximum rank. Additionally, the respective miniBar will no longer be displayed in those cases
	
	Fixed an issue where glow effects for the specIcons would not be applied correctly for tier 1 artifacts when too many traits were available
	

r22:
	Added option to toggle between using the international and localised number formats for each locale (experimental). It is accessible via slash command: /ap numberformat
	
	Updated detection for maxed artifact weapons (was disabled after tier 2 became available, but now applies to only tier 1 artifacts). They now show as "maxed" once again
	
	Fixed an issue that could cause high numbers of artifact power (> 2.14b) to break the addon's output under certain circumstances
	Fixed a bug that would cause tier 1 artifacts (those that haven't yet been upgraded via the Dalaran Council's quest chain) to display inaccurate values beyond the final, 54th trait
	Fixed a graphics glitch that caused the buttonText to collide with the bar display when using locales with a larger-than-normal default font size (koKR, zhCN, zhTW mainly) - this workaround is not ideal, and somewhat experimental
