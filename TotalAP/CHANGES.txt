## TotalAP v1.3.1 - Recent changes (3 releases)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

r21:
	Added slash command to hide the secondary progress bars ("MiniBar") -> /ap minibar
	
	Updated DB to include 7.2.5 artifact power items and their spell effects
	Updated translation for the Traditional Chinese (zhTW) locale - thanks for contributing!
	Modified progress bar tooltip to indicate when research is idle, and when the maximum AK level has been reached
	
	Fixed ingame description for the "/ap progress" slash command
	Fixed progress bar tooltip for artifact weapons that have never been used before
	Fixed a graphics glitch that could occur when the buttonText became too long to fit smoothly in its space
	Fixed a graphics glitch that lead to the MiniBar being displayed over other, arguably more important UI frames
	Fixed an issue where the displayed shipment info for Artifact Research Notes could be inaccurate
	
	
r20:
	Added secondary progress bar ("MiniBar"), which is displayed whenever more than one new trait is available
	
	ALT-clicking should now correctly allow dragging of the entire display, no matter which part was being clicked on (progress bars and spec icons included)
	Individual displays can no longer be dragged off-screen, and their anchor now resizes dynamically to make sure they fit even in the tightest corners ;)
	The action button now remains visible if artifact research notes (or similar tomes) are available, even if the active spec is being ignored

	Fixed broken localization for the recently-added progress tooltip
	Fixed various localization issues (such as a broken deDE translation and formatting mishaps)
	Fixed an oversight that would cause the initialisation routine to break on the very first login (or if the saved variables were deleted manually)


r19:
	Added option to ignore specs (on a per-character basis). Ignored specs will not trigger the action button to show and not have any displays. Right-clicking the spec icon will ignore it, while a newly-added slash command (/ap unignore) resets the "ignore list" for that character
	Added (hidden) option to align bars and specIcons to the top, bottom, or center (default), accessible via /ap align-top, align-bottom or align-center - (There will be a GUI option for this later, but you may use these slash commands in the meantime)
	Added tooltip for progress bars, displaying detailed information regarding the overall progress for that spec's artifact. In comparison, the progress bars themselves are limited to just the current rank (for now)

	Slash commands that change display options should once again update all displays properly
	
	Fixed broken slash commands that were causing LUA errors when used - "Accidents! They happen!"
	Fixed an issue that would cause the action button's size to not be saved throughout sessions
	Fixed display peculiarities (overlapping frames) that could occur if the action button's size was smaller than its buttonText
